# Phase 4 Syllabus

This phase is all about learning React and using React to make single-page
applications. By the end of the phase, you'll be able to create a React
application from scratch with a Rails API as a backend.

The overall structure of the phase looks like this:

- Week 1: React Fundamentals
- Week 2: Code Challenge; React Project Start; React Router
- Week 3: React Project End; Optional Lectures; Redux

## Week 1

The goal of the first week is to be comfortable with the fundamentals of React,
and be able to use React to make a dynamic single-page application that can
interact with data from an API.

### Week 1: Monday

We'll get comfortable with the building blocks of React: **components**. We'll
see how components can interact with one another via **props**. We'll also see
how **JSX** can be used to create DOM elements declaratively.

#### Objective: Build component hierarchies in React

- [ ] Visualize/identify Components on any website
- [ ] Understand how `create-react-app` works and what it offers a developer
- [ ] Briefly explain Babel's purpose in React
- [ ] Organize code into files and use the import-export syntax to pass data
      between components
- [ ] Explain what a React Component actually is in code
- [ ] Use JSX to build custom components and render them in the browser
- [ ] Use props to make components more dynamic and reusable

If you can complete the
[Components, Props and JSX Mini Project](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/react-hooks-component-props-mini-project)
you are in great shape!

#### Week 1: Monday - Labs

- Node Package Manager
- Introduction to React
- Components, Props and JSX

#### Week 1: Monday - Videos

- [Components and Props - Scrimba Playlist](https://scrimba.com/playlist/pzvM7hM)

### Week 1: Tuesday

We'll see how to handle some basic events in React, and how to make our
components dynamic by using **state**.

#### Objective: Make components dynamic by using State and Events

- [ ] Add event handlers to elements in React
- [ ] Use the `useState` hook to create state variables
- [ ] Create event handler callbacks that manipulate `state`
- [ ] Trigger re-renders by setting state
- [ ] Discuss some "gotchas" of working with `useState`: async code and closures

We'll have a
[State and Events Pairing lab](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/react-hooks-state-events-pairing)
to check for understanding on these concepts.

#### Week 1: Tuesday - Labs
