        author: "Prof. Helmut A. Fluffrey, Department of Fluff, Flufts University",
        description: "'Fluff is intrinsically a legal fiction,' says Derrida; however,according to Abian, it is not so much fluff that is intrinsically a legal fiction, but rather the collapse, and subsequent meaninglessness, of fluff. In a sense, the premise of Sontagist camp implies that a narrative of fluff is created by the collective unconscious.",

        title: "J.K. Rowling Ruined Harry Potter...Again",
        author: "Fluff Scott Fitzgerald",
        description: "Our problematic fav has returned once more, not unlike the Dark Lord himself at the end of The Goblet of Fire. In her latest twitter rant, disgraced author J.K. Rowling has announced that the real name of Hufflepuff was actually Flufflepuff all along. She went on to reassure all three of her remaining Twitter followers that the name of Fluffy, Rubeus Hagrid's famously slobbery three-headed dog, will not be changed. This clarification came after a 12 year old on fan site MuggleNet nervously speculated that the Cerberus-like beast's name might be on the chopping block. In true unhinged Rowling fashion, the author added that Fluffy is, in fact, a supporter of Greta Thunberg and the School Strike for Climate movement. Perhaps the strangest thing about these tweets is that J.K. Rowling thought anyone cared about Hufflepuff.",
